The [mindtastic user authentication system](https://github.com/mindtastic/bouncer) is characterized by it's ~~impenetrably complex and difficult to understand~~ unique, feature-rich authentication flow. As it befits for a state of the art cloud application an undoubtedly adequate number of microservices are involved in the authentication flow.

Even though these services have really cool names (like [bouncer](https://github.com/mindtastic/bouncer) and [koda](https://github.com/mindtastic/koda)), such a quantitive approach has some drawbacks, especially in mindtastics case. First of all, there a multiple services written in the same language - naturally a microservice antipattern. Second, in the current state some services are lacking persistence. An absolute no-go for mindtastics ~~business angels~~ scientific advisors, as according to them, deploying and operating a self-hosted database in a kubernetes cluster is fascinating, educative and fun (the *r* those adjectives stands for *reliable*). Last but not least, [search for *quantitive approach*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=quantitive+approach&btnG=) yields about five million results. A commonplace approach is absolutely inacceptable for a state-of-the-art, cutting-edge cloud engineers collective.

So. The Time has come to become even more cloud native. And for any project, how could you raise the **bar**? Add *Yet another **foo***!

We present **Yámas** (Yet another maddening authentication service). It's destiny is nothing less than becoming the *Elixir* for an improved, streamlined authentication flow, as it you could only imagine in your dreams.

All the services of the legacy authentication flow sat together with a cool refreshing glas of Ouzo and decided to join their forces. Instead of the stodgy, distrubed, Division of labour inspired flow, Yámas brings together what belongs together. All authentication-flow related services sit together at one table, enjoy life and the beauty of ~~social~~ elixir process interactions to the fullest and complete their tasks virtually as they go by. Just like in your favorite taverna. Jámas!

## Makes your dreams come true

## State of the project

The Elixir is still brewing. Code and Documentation will be added regularly and at short intervals.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc).
This will be done at some time in the future. For now, we keep this service even more maddening.
